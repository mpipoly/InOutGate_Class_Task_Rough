# P0010.5 Cross-experimental analysis

Resources for Math√¥t, S., Siebold, A., Donk, M., & Vitu, F., (in preparation). *Large Pupils Predict Goal-driven Eye Movements*.

## Analysis

To run the full analysis, execute:

	./fullAnalysis.sh
	
In addition to the standard Python modules for data processing (NumPy etc.), the analysis requires [`exparser`](https://github.com/smathot/exparser).

## Data

Every experiment has the following input files:

- `exp[X].data.csv` which contains trial info, with one trial per row.
- `exp[X].fixdur.csv` which is a list of fixation durations.
- `exp[x].fix.csv` contains the main input. This corresponds to `saccLog-processed.csv` from the original parser.

## Stimuli

Images, saliency maps, and luminance maps (as described in the manuscript) can be found in the folder `/stimuli/`. Due to license restrictions, for Exp. 2, only the fractals are provided. The scenes can be obtained from:

- <http://natural-scenes.cps.utexas.edu/>

## Manuscript

Manuscript source files can be found under `/manuscript/`.
